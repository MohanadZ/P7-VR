# P7-VR
There is a lack of research on the topic of visually representing vibrotactile feedback in VR. Consequently, a system was built with the intention of exploring ways of achieving the aforementioned.

The system is a multimodal design simulating the turbulence (vibrations) experienced during a commercial airline flight. It consists of a digital virtual environment of the interior of an airplane and a physical apparatus providing the vibrotactile feedback. The simulation is run in the Unity3D game engine.
Three different methods of visualization of the vibrotactile feedback are implemented:
1. A shaking effect is applied to specific objects in the virtual environment.
2. A shaking effect is applied to the screen through which the virtual environment is experienced.
3. A combined shaking effect of the two prior methods.
